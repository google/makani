Make the test programs under Unix by:

change options in ../config.make to match your environment
  % make 

Make the test programs under Windoze:

You need Visual C and either the Compaq Visual Fortran compiler or the Intel
Fortran compiler.  
compile and link with command in DOS window: 

C:\Xfoil\plotlib\examples: nmake /f Makefile.NT




Sample and test programs
-------------------------

volts.f      - demo program that draws a simple, labeled plot with axes.

volts_old.f  - demo program that draws a simple, labeled plot with axes.
               (uses old "Versatec" plot calls)

squares.f    - draws a sine wave in colored boxes, has colored labels

squaresdoublebuff.f - demo of double buffering, draws a sine wave in colored 
                      boxes that cycle across the sine wave w/o flickering

gridtest.f   - tests the grid routines (obvious, aren't we...)

symbols.f 
symbolsall.f - display and test the vector fonts 

cmap2.f 
cmap3.f      - used for interactive viewing of RGB color components:

zoomtest.f   - test of zooming

contest.f    - test of contouring primitives for color, filled contours

defmap.f     - displays the default colormap produced by CALL COLORMAPDEFAULT

spectrum.f   - displays the "Spectrum" produced by
               CALL COLORSPECTRUMHUES(ncols, RYGCBM_string)
               in pie and bar form.  

               Typical values for RYGCBM_string might be
                'RYG'
                'GYR'
                'MCY'
                'BMRY'
                'BCGYR',  etc.

               Choosing strongly non-contiguous sequences like 'RCB' is OK, 
               but will make a horrid-looking Spectrum.

sym/test.f   - display current vector fonts
