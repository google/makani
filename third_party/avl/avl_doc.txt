History
=======
AVL (Athena Vortex Lattice) 1.0 was originally written by Harold Youngren
circa 1988 for the MIT Athena TODOR aero software collection.  The code was
based on classic work by Lamar (NASA codes), E. Lan and L. Miranda (VORLAX) 
and a host of other investigators.  Numerous modifications have since been 
added by Mark Drela and Harold Youngren, to the point where only stubborn 
traces of the original Athena code remain.

Vortex-Lattice Modeling Principles
==================================
Like any computational method, AVL has limitations on what it can do.
These must be kept in mind in any given application.

Configurations
--------------
A vortex-lattice model like AVL is best suited for aerodynamic configurations
which consist mainly of thin lifting surfaces at small angles of attack
and sideslip.  These surfaces and their trailing wakes are represented 
as single-layer vortex sheets, discretized into horseshoe vortex filaments, 
whose trailing legs are assumed to be parallel to the x-axis.  AVL provides 
the capability to also model slender bodies such as fuselages and nacelles 
via source+doublet filaments.  The resulting force and moment predictions 
are consistent with slender-body theory, but the experience with this model 
is relatively limited, and hence modeling of bodies should be done with 
caution.  If a fuselage is expected to have little influence on the 
aerodynamic loads, it's simplest to just leave it out of the AVL model.
However, the two wings should be connected by a fictitious wing portion
which spans the omitted fuselage.

Unsteady flow
-------------
AVL assumes quasi-steady flow, meaning that unsteady vorticity shedding
is neglected.  More precisely, it assumes the limit of small reduced frequency,
which means that any oscillatory motion (e.g. in pitch) must be slow enough 
so that the period of oscillation is much longer than the time it takes
the flow to traverse an airfoil chord.  This is true for virtually any
expected flight maneuver.  Also, the roll, pitch, and yaw rates used 
in the computations must be slow enough so that the resulting relative 
flow angles are small.  This can be judged by the dimensionless 
rotation rate parameters, which should fall within the following 
practical limits.

-0.10 < pb/2V < 0.10
-0.03 < qc/2V < 0.03
-0.25 < rb/2V < 0.25

These limits represent extremely violent aircraft motion, and are unlikely
to exceeded in any typical flight situation, except possibly during
low-airspeed aerobatic maneuvers.  In any case, if any of these 
parameters falls outside of these limits, the results should be 
interpreted with caution.


Compressibility
---------------
Compressibility is treated in AVL using the classical Prandtl-Glauert (PG) 
transformation, which converts the PG equation to the Laplace equation,
which can then be solved by the basic incompressible method.  This
is equivalent to the compressible continuity equation, with the assumptions 
of irrotationality and linearization about the freestream.  The forces
are computed by applying the Kutta-Joukowsky relation to each vortex,
this remaining valid for compressible flow.

The linearization assumes small perturbations (thin surfaces) and is not 
completely valid when velocity perturbations from the free-stream become 
large.  The relative importance of compressible effects can be judged by 
the PG factor  1/B = 1/sqrt(1 - M^2), where "M" is the freestream Mach 
number.  A few values are given in the table, which shows the expected
range of validity. 

 M    1/B
---  -----
0.0  1.000  |
0.1  1.005  |
0.2  1.021  |
0.3  1.048  |- PG expected valid
0.4  1.091  |
0.5  1.155  |
0.6  1.250  |
0.7  1.400     PG suspect    (transonic flow likely)
0.8  1.667     PG unreliable (transonic flow certain)
0.9  2.294     PG hopeless

For swept-wing configurations, the validity of the PG model
is best judged using the wing-perpendicular Mach number

  Mperp  =  M cos(sweep)

Since Mperp < M, swept-wing cases can be modeled up to higher
M values than unswept cases.  For example, a 45 degree swept wing
operating at freestream M = 0.8 has 

  Mperp  =  0.8 * cos(45)  =  0.566

which is still within the expected range of PG validity 
in the above table.  So reasonable results can be expected
from AVL for this case.


When doing velocity parameter sweeps at the lowest Mach numbers, 
say below M = 0.2, it is best to simply hold M = 0.  This will
greatly speed up the calculations, since changing the Mach number 
requires recomputation and re-factorization of the VL influence matrix,
which consumes most of the computational effort.  If the Mach number
is held fixed, this computation needs to be done only once.


Input Files
===========
AVL works with three input files, all in plain text format.  Ideally 
these all have a common arbitrary prefix "xxx", and the following extensions:

xxx.avl     required main input file defining the configuration geometry
xxx.mass    optional file giving masses and inertias, and dimensional units
xxx.run     optional file defining parameters for some number of run cases

The user provides files xxx.avl and xxx.mass, which are typically created
using any text editor.  Sample files are provided for use as templates.
The xxx.run file is written by AVL itself with a user command.
It can be manually edited, although this is not really necessary
since it is more convenient to edit the contents in AVL and then
write out the file again.



Geometry Input File -- xxx.avl
==============================

This file describes the vortex lattice geometry and aerodynamic 
section properties.  Sample input files are in the runs/ subdirectory.


Coordinate system
-----------------
The geometry is described in the following Cartesian system:

  X   downstream
  Y   out the right wing
  Z   up

The freestream must be at a reasonably small angle to the X axis
(alpha and beta must be small), since the trailing vorticity 
is oriented parallel to the X axis.  The length unit used in
this file is referred to as "Lunit".  This is arbitrary, 
but must be the same throughout this file.  


File format
-----------

Header data
- - - - - - 
The input file begins with the following information in the first 5 non-blank,
non-comment lines:

Abc...              | case title

#                   | comment line begins with "#" or "!"

0.0                 | Mach
1     0     0.0     | iYsym  iZsym  Zsym
4.0   0.4   0.1     | Sref   Cref   Bref
0.1   0.0   0.0     | Xref   Yref   Zref
0.020               | CDp  (optional)



  Mach  = default freestream Mach number for Prandtl-Glauert correction

  iYsym =  1  case is symmetric about Y=0    , (X-Z plane is a solid wall)
        = -1  case is antisymmetric about Y=0, (X-Z plane is at const. Cp)
        =  0  no Y-symmetry is assumed

  iZsym =  1  case is symmetric about Z=Zsym    , (X-Y plane is a solid wall)
        = -1  case is antisymmetric about Z=Zsym, (X-Y plane is at const. Cp)
        =  0  no Z-symmetry is assumed (Zsym ignored)

  Sref  = reference area  used to define all coefficients (CL, CD, Cm, etc)
  Cref  = reference chord used to define pitching moment (Cm)
  Bref  = reference span  used to define roll,yaw moments (Cl,Cn)

  X,Y,Zref = default location about which moments and rotation rates are defined
             (if doing trim calculations, XYZref must be the CG location,
              which can be imposed with the MSET command described later)

  CDp = default profile drag coefficient added to geometry, applied at XYZref
         (assumed zero if this line is absent, for previous-version compatibility)



The default Mach, XYZref, and CDp values are superseded by the values 
in the .run file (described later), if it is present.  They can also
be changed at runtime.

Only the half (non-image) geometry must be input if symmetry is specified.
Ground effect is simulated with iZsym = 1, and Zsym = location of ground.

Forces are not calculated on the image/anti-image surfaces. 
Sref and Bref are assumed to correspond to the total geometry.

In practice there is little reason to run Y-symmetric image cases,
unless one is desperate for CPU savings.



Surface and Body data
- - - - - - - - - - - 
The remainder of the file consists of a set of keywords and associated data.  
Each keyword expects a certain number of lines of data to immediately follow 
it, the exception being inline-coordinate keyword AIRFOIL which is followed
by an arbitrary number of coordinate data lines.  The keywords must also be 
nested properly in the hierarchy shown below.  Only the first four characters 
of each keyword are actually significant, the rest are just a mnemonic.

  SURFACE
      COMPONENT (or INDEX)
      YDUPLICATE
      SCALE
      TRANSLATE
      ANGLE
      NOWAKE
      NOALBE

      etc.


The COMPONENT (or INDEX), YDUPLICATE, SCALE, TRANSLATE, and ANGLE keywords 
can all be used together.  If more than one of these appears for 
a surface, the last one will be used and the previous ones ignored.

At least two SECTION keywords must be used for each surface. 

The NACA, AIRFOIL, AFILE, keywords are alternatives.  
If more than one of these appears after a SECTION keyword, 
the last one will be used and the previous ones ignored.  i.e.

  SECTION
    NACA
    AFILE

is equivalent to

  SECTION
    AFILE

Multiple CONTROL keywords can appear after a SECTION keyword and data


Surface-definition keywords and data formats
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

*****

SURFACE              | (keyword)
Main Wing            | surface name string
12   1.0  20  -1.5   | Nchord  Cspace   [ Nspan Sspace ]

The SURFACE keyword declares that a surface is being defined until 
the next SURFACE or BODY keyword, or the end of file is reached.  
A surface does not really have any significance to the underlying 
AVL vortex lattice solver, which only recognizes the overall 
collection of all the individual horseshoe vortices.  SURFACE 
is provided only as a configuration-defining device, and also 
as a means of defining individual surface forces.  This is 
necessary for structural load calculations, for example.

  Nchord =  number of chordwise horseshoe vortices placed on the surface
  Cspace =  chordwise vortex spacing parameter (described later)

  Nspan  =  number of spanwise horseshoe vortices placed on the surface [optional]
  Sspace =  spanwise vortex spacing parameter (described later)         [optional]

If Nspan and Sspace are omitted (i.e. only Nchord and Cspace are present on line),
then the Nspan and Sspace parameters will be expected for each section interval,
as described later.


*****

COMPONENT       | (keyword) or INDEX 
3               | Lcomp

This optional keywords COMPONENT (or INDEX for backward compatibility)
allows multiple input SURFACEs to be grouped together into a composite 
virtual surface, by assigning each of the constituent surfaces the same 
Lcomp value.  Application examples are:
- A wing component made up of a wing SURFACE and a winglet SURFACE
- A T-tail component made up of horizontal and vertical tail SURFACEs.

A common Lcomp value instructs AVL to _not_ use a finite-core model
for the influence of a horseshoe vortex and a control point which lies
on the same component, as this would seriously corrupt the calculation.

If each COMPONENT is specified via only a single SURFACE block,
then the COMPONENT (or INDEX) declaration is unnecessary.


*****

YDUPLICATE      | (keyword)
0.0             | Ydupl

The YDUPLICATE keyword is a convenient shorthand device for creating 
another surface which is a geometric mirror image of the one 
being defined.  The duplicated surface is _not_ assumed to be 
an aerodynamic image or anti-image, but is truly independent.  
A typical application would be for cases which have geometric 
symmetry, but not aerodynamic symmetry, such as a wing in yaw.  
Defining the right wing together with YDUPLICATE will conveniently 
create the entire wing.

The YDUPLICATE keyword can _only_ be used if iYsym = 0 is specified.
Otherwise, the duplicated real surface will be identical to the
implied aerodynamic image surface, and velocities will be computed
directly on the line-vortex segments of the images.  This will 
almost certainly produce an arithmetic fault.

The duplicated surface gets the same Lcomp value as the parent surface,
so they are considered to be the same COMPONENT.  There is no significant 
effect on the results if they are in reality two physically-separate surfaces.


  Ydupl =  Y position of X-Z plane about which the current surface is 
           reflected to make the duplicate geometric-image surface.


*****

SCALE            |  (keyword)
1.0  1.0  0.8    | Xscale  Yscale  Zscale

The SCALE allows convenient rescaling for the entire surface.
The scaling is applied before the TRANSLATE operation described below. 

  Xscale,Yscale,Zscale  =  scaling factors applied to all x,y,z coordinates
                           (chords are also scaled by Xscale)


*****

TRANSLATE         |  (keyword)
10.0  0.0  0.5    | dX  dY  dZ

The TRANSLATE keyword allows convenient relocation of the entire 
surface without the need to change the Xle,Yle,Zle locations 
for all the defining sections.  A body can be translated without
the need to modify the body shape coordinates.

  dX,dY,dZ =  offset added on to all X,Y,Z values in this surface.

*****

ANGLE       |  (keyword)
2.0         | dAinc

The ANGLE keyword allows convenient changing of the incidence angle 
of the entire surface without the need to change the Ainc values 
for all the defining sections.  The rotation is performed about
the spanwise axis projected onto the y-z plane.

  dAinc =  offset added on to the Ainc values for all the defining sections
           in this surface

*****

NOWAKE     |  (keyword)

The NOWAKE keyword specifies that this surface is to NOT shed a wake,
so that its strips will not have their Kutta conditions imposed.
Such a surface will have a near-zero net lift, but it will still 
generate a nonzero moment.

*****

NOALBE    |  (keyword)

The NOALBE keyword specifies that this surface is unaffected by
freestream direction changes specified by the alpha,beta angles
and p,q,r rotation rates.  This surface then reacts to only to
the perturbation velocities of all the horseshoe vortices and 
sources and doublets in the flow.
This allows the SURFACE/NOALBE object to model fixed surfaces such 
as a ground plane, wind tunnel walls, or a nearby other aircraft 
which is at a fixed flight condition.

*****

NOLOAD    |  (keyword)

The NOLOAD keyword specifies that the force and moment on this surface
is to NOT be included in the overall forces and moments of the configuration.
This is typically used together with NOALBE, since the force on a ground
plane or wind tunnel walls certainly is not to be considered as part
of the aircraft force of interest.

*****
The following keyword declarations would be used in envisioned applications.

1) Non-lifting fuselage modeled by its side-view and top-view profiles.
This will capture the moment of the fuselage reasonably well.
NOWAKE

2) Another nearby aircraft, with both aircraft maneuvering together.
This would be for trim calculation in formation flight.
NOALBE
NOLOAD

3) Another nearby aircraft, with only the primary aircraft maneuvering.
This would be for a flight-dynamics analysis in formation flight.
NOLOAD

4) Nearby wind tunnel walls or ground plane.
NOALBE
NOLOAD

*****

SECTION                             |  (keyword)
0.0 5.0 0.2   0.50  1.50   5 -2.0   | Xle Yle Zle   Chord Ainc   [ Nspan Sspace ]

The SECTION keyword defines an airfoil-section camber line at some 
spanwise location on the surface.

  Xle,Yle,Zle =  airfoil's leading edge location
  Chord       =  the airfoil's chord  (trailing edge is at Xle+Chord,Yle,Zle)
  Ainc        =  incidence angle, taken as a rotation (+ by RH rule) about 
                 the surface's spanwise axis projected onto the Y-Z plane.  
  Nspan       =  number of spanwise vortices until the next section [ optional ]
  Sspace      =  controls the spanwise spacing of the vortices      [ optional ]


Nspan and Sspace are used here only if the overall Nspan and Sspace 
for the whole surface is not specified after the SURFACE keyword.
The Nspan and Sspace for the last section in the surface are always ignored.

Note that Ainc is used only to modify the flow tangency boundary 
condition on the airfoil camber line, and does not rotate the geometry 
of the airfoil section itself.  This approximation is consistent with 
linearized airfoil theory.

The local chord and incidence angle are linearly interpolated between
defining sections.  Obviously, at least two sections (root and tip)
must be specified for each surface.

The default airfoil camber line shape is a flat plate.  The NACA, AIRFOIL,
and AFIL keywords, described below, are available to define non-flat
camber lines.  If one of these is used, it must immediately follow 
the data line of the SECTION keyword.

All the sections in the surface must be defined in order across the span.

*****

NACA                      |    (keyword)
4300                      | section NACA camberline

The NACA keyword sets the camber line to the NACA 4-digit shape specified

*****

AIRFOIL   X1  X2          |(keyword)   [ optional x/c range ]
1.0   0.0                 | x/c(1)  y/c(1)
0.98  0.002               | x/c(2)  y/c(2)
 .     .                  |  .       .
 .     .                  |  .       .
 .     .                  |  .       .
1.0  -0.01                | x/c(N)  y/c(N)


The AIRFOIL keyword declares that the airfoil definition is input
as a set of x/c, y/c pairs.

  x/c,y/c =  airfoil coordinates 

The x/c, y/c coordinates run from TE, to LE, back to the TE again 
in either direction.  These corrdinates are splined, and the slope 
of the camber y(x) function is obtained from the middle y/c values 
between top and bottom.  The number of points N is deterimined 
when a line without two readable numbers is encountered.

If present, the optional X1 X2 parameters indicate that only the 
x/c range X1..X2 from the coordinates is to be assigned to the surface.
If the surface is a 20%-chord flap, for example, then X1 X2
would be 0.80 1.00.  This allows the camber shape to be easily 
assigned to any number of surfaces in piecewise manner.


*****

AFILE      X1  X2         | (keyword)   [ optional x/c range ]
filename                  | filename string

The AFILE keyword is essentially the same as AIRFOIL, except
that the x/c,y/c pairs are generated from a standard (XFOIL-type)
set of airfoil coordinates contained in the file "filename".  
The first line of this file is assumed to contain a string
with the name of the airfoil (as written out with XFOIL's SAVE
command).   If the path/filename has embedded blanks
double quotes should be used to delimit the string.

The optional X1 X2 parameters are used as in AIRFOIL.


*****

DESIGN                  | (keyword)
DName  Wdes             | design parameter name,  local weight

This declares that the section angle Ainc is to be virtually 
perturbed by a design parameter, with name DName and local
Wdes.  

For example, declarations for design variables "twist1" and "bias1"

DESIGN
twist1  -0.5

DESIGN 
bias1   1.0

Give an effective (virtual) section incidence that is set using the "twist1" 
and "bias1" design variables as:

  Ainc_total = Ainc  - 0.5*twist1_value + 1.0*bias_value

where twist1_value and bias1_value are design parameters specified at runtime.

The sensitivities of the flow solution to design variable changes
can be displayed at any time during program execution.  Hence,
design variables can be used to quickly investigate the effects
of twist changes on lift, moments, induced drag, etc.

Declaring the same design parameter with varying weights for multiple 
sections in a surface allows the design parameter to represent a convenient 
"design mode", such as linear washout, which influences all sections.

*****

CONTROL                              | (keyword)
elevator  1.0  0.6   0. 1. 0.   1.0  | name, gain,  Xhinge,  XYZhvec,  SgnDup



The CONTROL keyword declares that a hinge deflection at this section
is to be governed by one or more control variables.  An arbitrary
number of control variables can be used, limited only by the array
limit NDMAX.

The data line quantities are...

 name     name of control variable
 gain     control deflection gain, units:  degrees deflection / control variable
 Xhinge   x/c location of hinge.  
           If positive, control surface extent is Xhinge..1  (TE surface)
           If negative, control surface extent is 0..-Xhinge (LE surface)
 XYZhvec  vector giving hinge axis about which surface rotates 
           + deflection is + rotation about hinge by righthand rule
           Specifying XYZhvec = 0. 0. 0. puts the hinge vector along the hinge
 SgnDup   sign of deflection for duplicated surface
           An elevator would have SgnDup = +1
           An aileron  would have SgnDup = -1


Control derivatives will be generated for all control variables 
which are declared.


More than one variable can contribute to the motion at a section.
For example, for the successive declarations

CONTROL                         
aileron  1.0  0.7  0. 1. 0.  -1.0

CONTROL                         
flap     0.3  0.7  0. 1. 0.   1.0

the overall deflection will be

 control_surface_deflection  =  1.0 * aileron  +  0.3 * flap


The same control variable can be used on more than one surface.
For example the wing sections might have

CONTROL                         
flap     0.3   0.7  0. 1. 0.   1.0

and the horizontal tail sections might have

CONTROL                         
flap     0.03  0.5  0. 1. 0.   1.0

with the latter simulating 10:1 flap -> elevator mixing.


A partial-span control surface is specified by declaring
CONTROL data only at the sections where the control surface
exists, including the two end sections.  For example,
the following wing defined with three sections (i.e. two panels)
has a flap over the inner panel, and an aileron over the 
outer panel.

SECTION
0.0  0.0  0.0   2.0   0.0   | Xle Yle Zle   Chord Ainc
CONTROL                         
flap     1.0   0.80   0. 0. 0.   1   | name, gain,  Xhinge,  XYZhvec,  SgnDup

SECTION
0.0  8.0  0.0   2.0   0.0   | Xle Yle Zle   Chord Ainc
CONTROL

The control gain for a control surface does not need to be equal
at each section.  Spanwise stations between sections receive a gain
which is linearly interpolated from the two bounding sections.
This allows specification of flexible-surface control systems.
For example, the following surface definition models wing warping
which is linear from root to tip.  Note that the "hinge" is at x/c=0.0, 
so that the entire chord rotates in response to the aileron deflection.

SECTION
0.0  0.0  0.0   2.0   0.0   | Xle Yle Zle   Chord Ainc
CONTROL

aileron  1.0   0.     0. 0. 0.  -1   | name, gain,  Xhinge,  XYZhvec,  SgnDup



Non-symmetric control effects, such as Aileron Differential, can be specified
by a non-unity SgnDup magnitude.  For example, 

SECTION
0.0  6.0  0.0   2.0   0.0   | Xle Yle Zle   Chord Ainc
CONTROL

SECTION
0.0 10.0  0.0   2.0   0.0   | Xle Yle Zle   Chord Ainc
CONTROL                         
aileron  1.0   0.7    0. 0. 0.  -2.0   | name, gain,  Xhinge,  XYZhvec,  SgnDup

will result in the duplicated aileron having a deflection opposite and 
2.0 times larger than the defined aileron.  Note that this will have 
the proper effect only in one direction.  In the example above, the 
two aileron surfaces deflect as follows:

  Right control surface:   1.0*aileron         =  1.0*aileron
  Left  control surface:   1.0*aileron*(-2.0)  = -2.0*aileron

which is the usual way Aileron Differential is implemented if "aileron" is positive.
To get the same effect with a negative "aileron" control change, 
the definitions would have to be as follows.

SECTION
0.0  6.0  0.0   2.0   0.0   | Xle Yle Zle   Chord Ainc
CONTROL                         
aileron  2.0   0.7    0. 0. 0.  -0.5   | name, gain,  Xhinge,  XYZhvec,  SgnDup

SECTION
0.0 10.0  0.0   2.0   0.0   | Xle Yle Zle   Chord Ainc
CONTROL                         
aileron  2.0   0.7    0. 0. 0.  -0.5   | name, gain,  Xhinge,  XYZhvec,  SgnDup

This then gives:

  Right control surface:   2.0*aileron         = -2.0*(-aileron)
  Left  control surface:   2.0*aileron*(-0.5)  =  1.0*(-aileron)

which is the correct mirror image of the previous case if "aileron" is negative.

CLAF        |  (keyword)
CLaf        |  dCL/da scaling factor

This scales the effective dcl/da of the section airfoil as follows:
 dcl/da  =  2 pi CLaf
The implementation is simply a chordwise shift of the control point
relative to the bound vortex on each vortex element.

The intent is to better represent the lift characteristics 
of thick airfoils, which typically have greater dcl/da values
than thin airfoils.  A good estimate for CLaf from 2D potential
flow theory is

  CLaf  =  1 + 0.77 t/c

where t/c is the airfoil's thickness/chord ratio.  In practice,
viscous effects will reduce the 0.77 factor to something less.
Wind tunnel airfoil data or viscous airfoil calculations should
be consulted before choosing a suitable CLaf value.

If the CLAF keyword is absent for a section, CLaf defaults to 1.0, 
giving the usual thin-airfoil lift slope  dcl/da = 2 pi.

CDCL                         |  (keyword)

The CDCL keyword specifies a simple profile-drag CD(CL) function 
for this section.  The function is parabolic between CL1..CL2 and 
CL2..CL3, with rapid increases in CD below CL1 and above CL3.
See the SUBROUTINE CDCL header (in cdcl.f) for more details.

The CD(CL) function is interpolated for stations in between
defining sections.  Hence, the CDCL declaration on any surface 
must be used either for all sections or for none.

This specifies the shape of the body as an "airfoil" file
which gives the top or side view of the body, which is
assumed to have a round cross-section.  Hence, the diameter
of the body is the difference between the top and bottom 
Y values.  Bodies which are not round must be approximated
with an equivalent round body which has roughly the same
cross-sectional areas. If the path/filename has embedded blanks
double quotes should be used to delimit the string.



Vortex Lattice Spacing Distributions
------------------------------------

Discretization of the geometry into vortex lattice panels
is controlled by the spacing parameters described earlier:
Sspace, Cspace, Bspace

These must fall in the range  -3.0 ... +3.0 , and they
determine the spanwise and lengthwise horseshoe vortex 
or body line node distributions as follows:

 parameter                              spacing
 ---------                              -------

    1.0        cosine        ||  |    |      |      |    |  ||

    0.0        equal         |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

   -1.0        cosine        ||  |    |      |      |    |  ||

   -2.0       -sine          |     |     |    |    |   |  | ||

   -3.0        equal         |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

  Sspace (spanwise)  :    first section        ==>       last section
  Cspace (chordwise) :    leading edge         ==>       trailing edge
  Bspace (lengthwise):    frontmost point      ==>       rearmost point

An intermediate parameter value will result in a blended distribution.

The most efficient distribution (best accuracy for a given number of 
vortices) is usually the cosine (1.0) chordwise and spanwise.  If the 
wing does not have a significant chord slope discontinuity at the 
centerline, such as a straight, elliptical, or slightly tapered wing, 
then the -sine (-2.0) distribution from root to tip will be more 
efficient.  This is equivalent to a cosine distribution across the 
whole span.  The basic rule is that a tight chordwise distribution 
is needed at the leading and trailing edges, and a tight spanwise 
distribution is needed wherever the circulation is changing rapidly, 
such as taper breaks, and especially at flap breaks and wingtips.


A number of vortex-spacing rules must be followed to get good results 
from AVL, or any other vortex-lattice method:

1) In a standard VL method, a trailing vortex leg must not pass 
close to a downstream control point, else the solution will be garbage.  
In practice, this means that surfaces which are lined up along 
the x direction (i.e. have the same or nearly the same y,z coordinates), 
MUST have the same spanwise vortex spacing.  AVL relaxes this requirement
by employing a finite core size for each vortex on a surface which is 
influencing a control point in another aurface (unless the two surfaces
share the same COMPONENT declaration).  This feature can be disabled
by setting the core size to zero in the OPER sub-menu, Option 
sub-sub-menu, command C.  This reverts AVL to the standard VL method.

2) Spanwise vortex spacings should be "smooth", with no sudden
changes in spanwise strip width.  Adjust Nspan and Sspace parameters
to get a smooth distribution.  Spacing should be bunched at
dihedral and chord breaks, control surface ends, and especially
at wing tips.  If a single spanwise spacing distribution is specified 
for a surface with multiple sections, the spanwise distribution
will be fudged as needed to ensure that a point falls exactly
on the section location.  Increase the number of spanwise points
if the spanwise spacing looks ragged because of this fudging.

3) If a surface has a control surface on it, an adequate number
of chordwise vortices Nchord should be used to resolve the 
discontinuity in the camberline angle at the hingeline.  It is 
possible to define the control surface as a separate SURFACE
entity.  Cosine chordwise spacings then produce bunched points 
exactly at the hinge line, giving the best accuracy.  The two 
surfaces must be given the same COMPONENT and the same spanwise point 
spacing for this to work properly. Such extreme measures are 
rarely necessary in practice, however.  Using a single surface 
with extra chordwise spacing is usually sufficient.

4) When attempting to increase accuracy by using more vortices,
it is in general necessary to refine the vortex spacings in both 
the spanwise AND in the chordwise direction.  Refining only
along one direction may not converge to the correct result,
especially locally wherever the bound vortex line makes a sudden bend,
such as a dihedral break, or at the center of a swept wing.
In some special configurations, such as an unswept planar wing, 
the chordwise spacing may not need to be refined at all to
get good accuracy, but for most cases the chordwise spacing 
will be significant.



Mass Input File -- xxx.mass
===========================

This optional file describes the mass and inertia properties of the 
configuration.  It also defines units to be used for run case setup.  
These units may want to be different than those used to define 
the geometry.  Sample input xxx.mass files are in the runs/ subdirectory.

The geometry axes used in the xxx.mass file are exactly the same as those used
in the xxx.avl file.

Units
- - -
The first three lines

  Lunit = 0.0254 m
  Munit = 0.001  kg
  Tunit = 1.0    s

give the magnitudes and names of the units to be used for run case setup
and possibly for eigenmode calculations.  In this example, standard SI units
(m,kg,s) are chosen.  But the data in xxx.avl and xxx.mass is given in units
of Lunit = 1 inch, which is therefore declared here to be equal to "0.0254 m".
If the data was given in centimeters, the statement would read

  Lunit = 0.01 m

and if it was given directly in meters, it would read

  Lunit = 1.0 m

Similarly, Munit used here in this file is the gram, but since the kilogram (kg) 
is to be used for run case calculations, the Munit declaration is

  Munit = 0.001 kg

If the masses here were given in ounces, the declaration would be

  Munit = 0.02835 kg

The third line gives the time unit name and magnitude.

If any of the three unit lines is absent, that unit's magnitude will
be set to 1.0, and the unit name will simply remain as "Lunit", 
"Munit", or "Tunit".



Constants
- - - - -
The 4th and 5th lines give the default gravitational acceleration and
air density, in the units given above.  If these statements are absent,
these constants default to 1.0, and will need to be changed manually at runtime.


Mass, Position, and Inertia Data
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
A line which begins with a "*" specifies multipliers to be applied
to all subsequent data.  If such a line is absent, these default to 1.
A line which begins with a "+" specifies added constants to be applied
to all subsequent data.  If such a line is absent, these default to 0.

Lines whith only numbers are interpreted as mass, position, and inertia data.
Each such line contains values for 

  mass   x     y     z      Ixx     Iyy      Izz    Ixz

as described in the file comments above.  Note that the inertias are
taken about that item's own mass centroid given by x,y,z.  The finer
the mass breakdown, the less important these self-inertias become.

Additional multiplier or adder lines can be put anywhere in the data lines,
and these then re-define these mulipliers and adders for all subsequent lines.
For example:

#  mass   x     y     z      Ixx     Iyy      Izz    Ixz

*   1.2   1.    1.    1.     1.     1.        1.     1.

   58.0   3.34 -12.0  1.05   4400   180       4580    0.   ! left wing

   16.0  -5.2   0.0   0.0        0    80         80    0.  ! fuselage pod
   18.0  13.25  0.0   0.0        0   700        700    0.  ! boom+rods
   22.0  -7.4   0.0   0.0        0     0          0    0.  ! battery
 

Data lines 1-2 have all their masses scaled up by 1.2, and their locations
shifted by delta(x) = 0.2.  Data lines 3-5 revert back to the defaults.



Run-Case Save File -- xxx.run
=============================

This file is generated by AVL itself.  It can be edited with a text editor,
although this is not really necessary.  The parameter values in the file
can be changed using AVL's menus, and the file can then be written again.
Manipulating and using the contents of the run file will be described later.



Program Execution
=================

AVL is executed with the "xxx" descriptor as an argument:

  % avl xxx

If the three filenames do not obey the recommended xxx.avl xxx.run xxx.mass 
syntax, the full filenames can be given explicitly:

  % avl avl_file run_file mass_file


As the data files are read and processed, a considerable 
data dump is displayed.  If any file has a bad format,
the offending data line is displayed, and AVL will stop
if the error is fatal.

After the files are processed, the user is put into 
the main AVL menu:


 ==========================================================
   Quit    Exit program

  .OPER    Compute operating-point run cases
  .MODE    Eigenvalue analysis of run cases

   MSET i  Apply mass file data to stored run case(s)

The uppercase words in the menu are commands.  They will
also be shown in uppercase in the examples below, but
they are not case sensitive when typed.

The eight bottom commands followed by T or F are toggles, 
which enable/disable plotting of various stuff of interest.
The loading vector plotting controlled by the LO toggle

The K command enters a sub-sub menu which allows interactive rotation 
of the aircraft to a suitable viewing angle, zooming, distortion for
perspective, etc.

Calculation Setup
- - - - - - - - -
A flow calculation involves a number of _operating variables_ which 
are additional unknowns determined as part of the calculation.
The left column in the top block of the OPER menu lists the available 
operating variables (alpha, beta, ... rudder):

 ==========================================================

  variable          constraint              
  ------------      ------------------------
  A lpha        ->  alpha       =   3.000         
  B eta         ->  beta        =   0.000         
  R oll  rate   ->  pb/2V       =   0.000         
  P itch rate   ->  qc/2V       =   0.000         
  Y aw   rate   ->  rb/2V       =   0.000         
  D1 elevator   ->  elevator    =   0.000         
  D2 rudder     ->  rudder      =   0.000         
  ------------      ------------------------

and the right column gives the constraint for each variable.  
The default constraints are simple direct constraints as shown above.

Variables can also be constrained indirectly.  For example, 
typing the alpha command "A" produces the list of available 
constraints for selection:

 Select command   c>  a

       constraint            value     
      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
   ->  A    alpha       =   3.000    
       B    beta        =   0.000    
       R    pb/2V       =   0.000    
       P    qc/2V       =   0.000    
       Y    rb/2V       =   0.000    
       C    CL          =   0.000    
       S    CY          =   0.000    
       RM   Cl roll mom =   0.000    
       PM   Cm pitchmom =   0.000    
       YM   Cn yaw  mom =   0.000    
       D1   elevator    =   0.000    
       D2   rudder      =   0.000    

      Select new  constraint,value  for alpha          c>  

The arrow indicates the current constraint.  A new constraint
and value can be specified.  Typing

  C 0.7

at the above prompt will make alpha be implicitly constrained 
by the condition CL = 0.7, as now indicated by the new main menu:

 =========================================
  variable          constraint            
 -------------      ----------------------
  A lpha        ->  CL          =  0.7000         
  B eta         ->  beta        =   0.000         
  R oll  rate   ->  pb/2V       =   0.000         
  P itch rate   ->  qc/2V       =   0.000         
  Y aw   rate   ->  rb/2V       =   0.000         
  D1 elevator   ->  elevator    =   0.000         
  D2 rudder     ->  rudder      =   0.000         
 -------------      ----------------------
.
.

A constraint can be used no more than once.

For convenience, a variable, its constraint, and the constraint value
can all be specified on one line at the OPER prompt.  For example...

  D1 PM 0
  D2 YM 0

sets the constraint on d1 (elevator) to be zero pitching moment,
and the constraint on d2 (rudder) to be zero yawing moment.
Normally, aileron is constrained by a zero rolling moment.
For a rudder/elevator aircraft, as implied by the above menu
without aileron, a nonzero sideslip is determined by the 
zero rolling moment constraint:

  B RM 0

This will be well-posed only if the aircraft's roll moment
is sufficiently dependent on the sideslip angle (i.e. if it has
sufficient dihedral effect).  


Flow Solution
- - - - - - -
Once all the appropriate constraints are set up, the solution
is executed with the X command.  If the variable/constraint
system is ill-posed, the solution will probably not converge.


Output
- - - -
Everytime a calculation is executed, the integrated forces are displayed 
for the entire configuration.  Forces for the individual surfaces,
strips, or vortex elements can be dsplayed with the FN, FS, FE commands.
The element force printout is rather voluminous and often not very 
informative.  Forces on bodies can be displayed using the FB command.

The force and moment directions are in stability axes x,y,z, which 
are tilted up by the angle alpha from the body axes X,Y,Z:

 | x |     | cos(a)    sin(a)| | X |
 | y |  =  |        1        | | Y |
 | z |     |-sin(a)    cos(a)| | Z |


The following standard normalizations are used,  with  Q = 0.5 rho V^2 ...

 CD = F_x / (Q Sref)            drag
 CY = F_y / (Q Sref)            side force
 CL = F_z / (Q Sref)            lift

 Cl = M_x / (Q Sref Bref)       roll  moment
 Cm = M_y / (Q Sref Cref)       pitch moment
 Cn = M_z / (Q Sref Bref)       yaw   moment

The CD,CY,CL forces are positive in the direction of the x,y,z axes, 
respectively.  The moments can be defined in four possible ways:

             Body axes     Stability axes
          ---------------  --------------
Geometric|   X   Y   Z        x   y   z
         |
Standard |  -X   Y  -Z       -x   y  -z


Rates    |   p   q   r        p'  q'  r'
Moments  |   Cl  Cm  Cn       Cl' Cm' Cn'        

with the rates and moments positive by righthand rule about
the indicated axes.

The roll, pitch, and yaw rates (p,q,r) input from the operating 
menu are defined in either the body axes or the stability axes,
depending on which is chosen in the Options sub-menu.

It must be pointed out that if sideslip (beta) is nonzero, then
CD and CY are not the true "drag" and "side-force" aligned with
the relative wind direction.  Likewise for moments Cl and Cm.  
The wind-axes directions are given by

 | x |          | cos(b) sin(b)    | | x |
 | y |       =  |-sin(b) cos(b)    | | y |
 | z |_wind     |                1 | | z |

                | cos(b)cos(a)   sin(b)   cos(b)sin(a)| | X |
             =  |-sin(b)cos(a)   cos(b)  -sin(b)sin(a)| | Y |
                |      -sin(a)     0            cos(a)| | Z |

hence

 CD_wind =  CD cos(b) + CY sin(b)
 CY_wind =  CY cos(b) - CD sin(b)
 CL_wind =  CL

 Cl_wind =  Cl cos(b) + Cm sin(b)
 Cm_wind =  Cm cos(b) - Cl sin(b)
 Cn_wind =  Cn


AVL does not display these wind-axes forces since they are not
relevant to stability and control calculations, and differ from the 
stability-axes forces only if a steady-state sideslip is present, 
such as perhaps in a steady turn.  The primary quantity of interest 
here is the overall L/D = CL_wind/CD_wind = CL/CD_wind, and CD_wind 
is more accurately obtained from the Trefftz-Plane anyway.

The alternative Trefftz-Plane drag coefficient CDi is calculated 
from the wake trace in the Y-Z plane far downstream.  This is 
generally more reliable than the CD obtained from surface force 
integration, and is the appropriate wind-axes induced drag for 
performance prediction.

The span efficiency is defined as

           2    2                              2
  e  =  (CL + CY ) / (pi A CDi)    ;   A = Bref / Sref

with Sref being replaced by  2 Sref  for Y-image cases (iYsym = 1).


Stability derivatives
---------------------

Command ST generates the stability derivative matrix for the
current conditions.  Derivatives with respect to control 
variables and design parameters are also displayed if
they are available.

Command SB generates the stability derivative matrix
in the body axes (AVL's X,Y,Z coordinates).


Flow Results Plotting
---------------------

The T command starts up the Trefftz Plane plot menu:

 ======================================================
   Y plot data vs Y
   Z plot data vs Z
   P erpendicular cl plot toggle (currently  T)
   D ownwash angle   plot toggle (currently  T)

   L imits for plot
   R eset plot limits

   C olor hardcopy  toggle (currently  F)
   A nnotate plot
   H ardcopy current plot

   ZM zoom
   U nzoom
   S ize change

 Trefftz plot command: 


Most of these plot options are self-explanatory.

The definitions of cl and perpendicular-cl (clT) are as follows:

  cl   =  2 L' / (rho V^2  c)  ~  2 Gamma / (V  c)
  clT  =  2 L' / (rho VT^2 c)  ~  2 Gamma / (VT c)

where  

  L'  =  Sum_chord [ rho Gamma V x l ]
  V   =  freestream speed
  VT  =  V cos(sweep)
  
and "sweep" is the local sweep angle of the surface's quarter-chord line.  
This quarter-chord line choice can be set to any other chordwise position 
by the SAXFR variable in avl.f (currently set at 0.25).  Both cl and clT 
are displayed on the Trefftz-Plane plot, but for a strongly 3D geometry
they must be interpreted with care.

In the Trefftz plane context, only the lift/span loading L', or equivalently

  cl c/Cref  =  2 Gamma / (V Cref) 
  cl c/Cref  =  2 L' / (rho V^2 Cref)

is what matters for the overall lift and induced drag.  The local cl
merely indicates the intensity of the chordwise loading in the 
streamwise direction.  But since boundary layer development doesn't
depend only on the streamwise pressure gradients, this cl may or may not 
be a good indicator of local stall.

For high aspect ratio swept wings, the surface boundary layer development 
depends only on the airfoil shape and the velocities projected onto the plane 
perpendicular to the spanwise axis (the thinner "streamwise" airfoil shapes 
and streamwise pressure gradients are not significant in this case).  
The stall margin is then described by the local clT, which is referenced 
to the local wing-perpendicular dynamic pressure.  

So to summarize the relevance of cl and clT:

* High-AR unswept surface:  
  -> cl, clT are the same, with the conventional 2D section interpretation.

* High-AR swept surface:
  -> clT is the correct stall indicator, provided spanwise gradients are small.

* Strongly 3D geometry, with rapidly varying chord and/or sweep:
  -> cl is probably a better indicator of stall.  clT is probably meaningless.




Trimmed Flight Condition Setup
------------------------------

The C1 command in the OPER menu enters the setup routine for level or banked 
trimmed horizontal flight.  This simply provides a convenient way to set up 
the required constraints for OPER without laborious manual calculations.

An aircraft mass and air properties are required.  These can be provided by 
a mass file which is read in during program startup, or from the main AVL menu.  
If a mass file was not read in, the necessary information can be input manually 
here in the C1 sub-menu.

The C1 routine works with the following variables and trim equations:

 phi    (arbitrary bank angle, positive to right)
 CL     (arbitrary CL, whatever is being specified)
 m      (mass)
 g      (gravity acceleration)
 rho    (air density)
 S      (reference area,  given in input file as SREF)

 V = sqrt(2 m g / rho S CL cos(phi))    (airspeed)
 R = V^2 / g tan(phi)        (turn radius, positive for right turn)
 W = V / R                   (turn rate, positive for right turn)
 p = 0                       (roll rate, zero for steady turn)
 q = W sin(phi)              (pitch rate, positive nose upward)
 r = W cos(phi)              (yaw rate, positive for right turn)


These equations are evaluated if possible (if the parameters are available),
and the following display/modification menu is then entered:

     Setup of trimmed run case 1/7:  0 deg. bank                             
     (level or banked horizontal flight)
     =================================================
      B  bank angle =  0.000      deg
      C  CL         = 0.7000       
      V  velocity   =  5.648      m/s
      M  mass       = 0.9195      kg
      D  air dens.  =  1.225      kg/m^3
      G  grav.acc.  =  9.810      m/s^2
         turn rad.  =  0.000      m
         load fac.  =  1.000       
      X  X_cg       =  3.400      Lunit
      Y  Y_cg       =  0.000      Lunit
      Z  Z_cg       = 0.5000      Lunit

     Enter parameter, value  (or  # - + N )   c>  


A parameter can be changed by giving its command and value.  For example, typing

  B 20

changes the bank angle to 20 degrees.  The equations are then immediately
re-evaluated with this new parameter, and the menu is displayed again with
the new resulting flight variables:

     Setup of trimmed run case 1/7:  0 deg. bank                             
     (level or banked horizontal flight)
     =================================================
      B  bank angle =  20.00      deg
      C  CL         = 0.7000       
      V  velocity   =  5.891      m/s
      M  mass       = 0.9195      kg
      D  air dens.  =  1.225      kg/m^3
      G  grav.acc.  =  9.810      m/s^2
         turn rad.  =  9.719      m
         load fac.  =  1.064       
      X  X_cg       =  3.400      Lunit
      Y  Y_cg       =  0.000      Lunit
      Z  Z_cg       = 0.5000      Lunit

     Enter parameter, value  (or  # - + N )   c>  


Note that the velocity, turn radius, and load factor have all been recomputed
to match the new specified bank angle and the current CL.  In general, any
parameter with a command key in the menu can be changed, and the others
will be recomputed to match.

The X_cg, Y_cg, Z_cg parameters do not enter directly into the trim calculations here,
but they are used to set Xref, Yref, Zref when the VL calculation is finally executed.
Hence they will affect the control deflections needed to enforce trim.



Special commands
- - - - - - - - -
The special commands (# - + N) have exactly the same action as in the OPER menu.
The "N" command can be used to change the case name.  For example:

  N  20 deg. bank


A different case can be brought up just by typing its index.  For example,

  5

shows the parameters for case 5:

     Setup of trimmed run case 5/7:  40 deg. bank                            
     (level or banked horizontal flight)
     =================================================
      B  bank angle =  40.00      deg
      C  CL         = 0.7000       
      V  velocity   =  6.453      m/s
      M  mass       = 0.9195      kg
      D  air dens.  =  1.225      kg/m^3
      G  grav.acc.  =  9.810      m/s^2
         turn rad.  =  5.059      m
         load fac.  =  1.305       
      X  X_cg       =  3.400      Lunit
      Y  Y_cg       =  0.000      Lunit
      Z  Z_cg       = 0.5000      Lunit

     Enter parameter, value  (or  # - + N )   c>  

The current case can be deleted with the "-" command.
A new case can be created with the "+" command.


Multiple-case commands
- - - - - - - - - - - -
Frequently, it is desirable to set a parameter to one value for all run cases,
such as the air density, for example.  Rather than repetitively switching
to each run case and setting its density, e.g. 

 1
 D 0.8
 2
 D 0.8
 3
 D 0.8
 .
 .

one can set the value for ALL the run cases by typing the parameter command twice:

 DD 0.8

This works for all parameters in the menu, and can save considerable typing.


Moment trim setup
- - - - - - - - - 
Once the C1 trim menu is exited by just typing "Enter", it may 
still be necessary to set up zero-moment constraints for the 
various control deflections.  The C1 menu cannot do this for the user,
since it has no way of knowing what each control variable does.


Execution
- - - - - 
Execution after the C1 trim setup is performed with the X command as usual.
It is easy to compute each run case that is set up simply by typing its
integer index, followed by X.  For example,

 1
 X
 2
 X
 .
 .

Any one computed run case can of course be examined via the listings or plotting.

An alternative to converging each run case separately, one can 
issue the XX command, which will converge ALL the run cases. 
It is a good idea to converge all the cases before saving the 
run case file with the S command, so that all the parameters
in the xxx.run file have their converged values.




Looping-Flight Condition Setup
------------------------------

The C2 command in the OPER menu allows a convenient way
to set up constraints required to achieve a specified 
looping flight.  The necessary AVL parameters are computed 
using the following variables and equations:

 CL     (arbitrary CL, whatever is being specified)
 m      (mass)
 g      (gravity acceleration)
 rho    (air density)
 R      (turn radius)
 N      (load factor)
 S      (reference area,  given in input file as SREF)

 R = 2 m / ( rho S CL )
 N = 0.5 rho V^2 S CL / (m g)
 p = 0                           (roll rate)
 q = V/R                         (pitch rate)
 r = 0                           (yaw rate)


These equations are evaluated if possible (if the parameters are available),
and the following display/modification menu is then entered:

     Setup of trimmed run case 1/7:  looping flight
     (steady pitch rate - looping flight)
     =================================================
      C  CL        = 0.7000       
      V  velocity  =  5.648      m/s
      M  mass      = 0.9195      kg
      D  air dens. =  1.225      kg/m^3
      G  grav.acc. =  9.810      m/s^2
      R  turn rad. =  3.324      m
      L  load fac. =  1.000       
      X  X_cg      =  3.400      Lunit
      Y  Y_cg      =  0.000      Lunit
      Z  Z_cg      = 0.5000      Lunit

     Enter parameter, value  (or  # - + N )   c>  


The procedure here is the same as with the C1 menu.  Any parameter 
can be specified, and the remaining ones are computed to match.
The case is then executed in the OPER menu with the X command.


Parameter Modification Menu
---------------------------
The M command enters the general parameter modification sub-menu:


     Parameters of run case 1/7:  0 deg. bank                             
      B  bank      =  0.000      deg
      E  elevation =  0.000      deg
      MA Mach no.  =  0.000       
      V  velocity  =  5.648      m/s
      D  air dens. =  1.225      kg/m^3
      G  grav.acc. =  9.810      m/s^2
      M  mass      = 0.9195      kg

      X  X_cg      =  3.400      Lunit
      Y  Y_cg      =  0.000      Lunit
      Z  Z_cg      = 0.5000      Lunit
      CD CDo       = 0.1700E-01   
      LA dCL_a     =  0.000       
      LU dCL_u     =  0.000       
      MA dCM_a     =  0.000       
      MU dCM_u     =  0.000       

     Enter parameter, value  (or  # - + N )   c>  


This is in effect a "dumb" version of the C1 and C2 sub-menus.
It simply accepts new parameter values without trying to apply
any trim equations.  Only a few of these parameters, such as
Mach and XYZ_cg will affect OPER's solution calculation. 
The remaining parameters are used for eigenmode calculations
described next.


Run Case File Contents
----------------------
A run case file can be listed to show its contents.  
One case block in the file is shown below:

The upper sub-block specifies the constraint associated with each
operating parameter, and is exactly what appears at the top of the 
OPER menu.

The lower sub-block simply lists all the current parameter values.
If this run case was not converged before the run case file was written, 
the operating parameter values may not correspond to the specified
constraints.  For example, the top constraint 

alpha        ->  alpha       =   4.00000    

indicates that alpha is to be driven to 4.0 degrees, so the alpha value line

 alpha     =   2.31230     deg   

is not "up to date".  The CL value line 

 CL        =  0.312309       

is therefore probably not up to date either.  Such "stale" parameter
values may or may not be of consequence.  A stale alpha or CL value
doesn't matter, since the run case will always be converged before
it is used for plotting, listing output, or eigenmode analysis.  
In any case, issuing the XX command in OPER before saving the 
run case file will ensure that alpha and CL are up to date.


The dimensional parameter values related to the aircraft mass, e.g.

 density   =   1.22500     kg/m^3                          
 grav.acc. =   9.81000     m/s^2             
 X_cg      =   2.95775
 Y_cg      =   0.00000
 Z_cg      =  0.609524
 mass      =  0.231000     kg                              
 Ixx       =  0.165803E-01 kg-m^2                          
 Iyy       =  0.113692E-01 kg-m^2                          
 Izz       =  0.278108E-01 kg-m^2                          
 Ixy       =  0.304560E-10 kg-m^2                          
 Iyz       = -0.135360E-10 kg-m^2                          
 Izx       = -0.362168E-03 kg-m^2                    

may also be "stale" if the mass file which was used to create this data
has since been modified.  The stale data can be changed to reflect the 
new mass file using the MSET command at top level.

Finally, the velocity, turn radius, and load factor data,

 velocity  =   5.42671     m/s                             
 turn_rad. =   0.00000     m                               
 load_fac. =   1.00000                           

which depends on the mass file as well as the CL, will probably
need to be updated is the mass file is changed.  This can be
done manually, or by using the C1 or C2 trim menus of OPER.



MODE Routine -- Eigenmode Analysis
==================================

AVL has the capability to perform eigenmode analysis and display
the results in a number of ways.  Meaningful use of this facility 
requires that a realistic configuration is defined, along with 
realistic mass, inertia, and CG data.  The mass, inertia, and CG
data can be input directly (in OPER's C1,C2, or M submenus),
or obtained from a xxx.mass file.

One or more trimmed run cases must also be first set up and checked 
for correctness in the OPER menu.  These cases can be saved to the 
xxx.run file from OPER, which is then read in later during AVL startup.
Any other run case file can be read in later using the CASE command 
from the main menu.


Typing MODE from the main AVL menu brings up the MODE menu,
preceded by the currently-defined run cases, if any.

The run cases serve as the baseline states about which the eigenmodes are defined.
The ">" indicator in the menu above shows that run case 3 is currently the chosen
baseline state.  This is changed just by typing the new run case index.  

Typing "0" (zero) makes all the cases as chosen baseline states.  Computation of
all their roots will then create root locii.  This is useful for investigating
the effect of an operating parameter (e.g. V, CL, X_cg, bank, etc.) on the roots.


Parameter editing
- - - - - - - - -
If the run case parameters are not correct, they can be changed with the M command.  
For example:

 M

     Parameters of run case 1/7:  0 deg. bank                             
      B  bank      =  0.000      deg

      IZ Izz       = 0.2790      kg-m^2
      X  X_cg      =  3.400      Lunit
      Y  Y_cg      =  0.000      Lunit
      Z  Z_cg      = 0.5000      Lunit
      CD CDo       = 0.1700E-01   
      LA dCL_a     =  0.000       
      LU dCL_u     =  0.000       
      MA dCM_a     =  0.000       
      MU dCM_u     =  0.000       

     Enter parameter, value  (or  # - + N )   c>  


This menu is the same as in OPER.  Note that changing a parameter may not 
then represent a trimmed flight condition.  If the baseline state is to be
trimmed, as is done with traditional eigenmode analyses, the parameter changes 
are probably best performed in the C1 or C2 menu in OPER.


CL,CM derivative modifiers
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The LA,LU,MA,MU commands in the M menu allow specifying explicit 
added changes to the CL and CM derivatives with respect to alpha
and speed.  The alpha derivative modifications dCL_a, dCM_a might 
represent stall, or perhaps effects of separation bubble movement.
The speed derivative modifications dCL_u, dCM_u might represent
Mach or Reynolds number effects on the wing or tail airfoils.
These derivative modifiers are used only for the eigenmode calculations
in the MODE menu.  They do not in any way affect the analysis calculations 
in OPER.


Mode calculation
- - - - - - - - -
The eigenmodes for one or all run cases are computed with the N command.
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are listed, and the eigenvalues are also
plotted on a root map.  This can be re-plotted at anytime with the P command,
or examined more closely with Z or B.


Mode Examination
- - - - - - - - -
The motion of any mode can be viewed in real time by issuing the X command,
and then clicking on the root symbol.  This brings up the mode-view menu:


  ------------------------------
   L eft           R ight       
   U p             D own        
   C lear

   I ngress        O utgress    
   H ardcopy       A nnotate    

   P anning camera toggle: T

  < > 0  mode play -- real time 
  - + 1  mode scale             
  S      mode sign change

 Type in plot window:  Command,  or  <space> to exit


All commands must be typed with the cursor in the graphics window.
The viewpoint can be set with the L,R,U,D,C keys, like in the 
geometry viewer in OPER.  

The mode motion is rewound or advanced in time with the < and > keys
(shift key is not necessary).  Holding down these keys will play the
mode forward or backward in real time.  Typing 0 will jump back to
the starting time.

The mode scale will decay or grow in time depending on the real part 
of the eigenvalue.  But this can be arbitrarily scaled up or down
with the - and + keys.  The 1 key sets the scale factor to a nominal
"normal" size. 

The P command controls the camera-panning toggle.  If panning is on,
the camera follows the aircraft at the baseline motion, so that the
baseline state appears stationary.  If panning is off, the baseline
state moves, with the eigenmode motion superimposed on top of it.
Viewing either with or without panning may be best, depending 
on the mode.


System matrix output
- - - - - - - - - - -
Eigenmode analysis begins by considering that the unsteady flight variables
U(t) consist of the steady baseline state Uo plus an unsteady perturbation u(t).
The control variables D are considered the same way.

 U(t) = Uo + u(t)
 D(t) = Do + d(t)

The perturbations are governed by the following linear system:
.
u  =  A u  +  B d

The A and B system matrices depend on Uo and Do.  They can be listed
with the S command from the MODE menu.  The 12 components of the u(t)
vector are ordered as follows:


u      x velocity  (+ forward)
w      z velocity  (+ down)
q      pitch rate  (+ nose up)
theta  pitch angle (+ nose up)

v      y velocity  (+ to right)
p      roll rate   (+ to right)
r      yaw rate    (+ to right)
phi    roll angle  (+ to right)

x      x displacement  (+ forward)
y      y displacement  (+ to right)
z      z displacement  (+ down)
psi    heading angle   (+ to right)


The d(t) control vector components are whatever controls were declared
in the xxx.avl file, in the order that they appeared.




Plotting Options
================

The top-level PLOP command produces the plot option menu,
shown below with the default values.  Most of these parameters
must be changed before the first plot is made, otherwise they
may not have the intended effect.

 ...............................................

  G raphics-enable flag         T
  C olor PostScript output?     F
  I ndividual PS file output?   F
  A spect ratio of plot object   0.0000
  S ize of plot object           9.00"
  P age dimensions              11.00 x  8.50"
  M argins from page edges       0.00",  0.00"

  O rientation of plot:        Landscape 
  B lowup input method:        Keyboard  

      Option, Value   (or <Return>)    c>  


Toggling the Graphics-enable flag to F is recommended if
AVL is being executed in batch mode using a command file.

Normally, all hardcopy goes to the single multi-page plot.ps file.
Toggling the Individual PS file flag to T will place successive
hardcopy pages in an individual files, named
plot000.ps
plot001.ps
plot002.ps
etc.
These may then be used to create mode animation, etc.

The other parameters and options are mostly self-explanatory.
