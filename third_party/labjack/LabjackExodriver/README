Exodriver: Linux (kernel 2.6+) and Mac OS X low-level LabJack U12, U3, U6, UE9,
Digit and T7 USB library 2.0 and C examples

support@labjack.com

This package contains the liblabjackusb 2.0 USB library for low-level U3, U6,
UE9, Digit and T7 USB communications and C examples for select LabJack devices.

Refer to the INSTALL.Linux or INSTALL.MacOSX file for library requirements,
installation instructions, and compiling information (library and examples).
Note that the Exodriver requires the libusb-1.0 library.

Library source code files are located in the liblabjackusb directory.

C examples are provided for the LabJack U12, U3, U6, and UE9 in the examples
directory. They demonstrate basic open/write/read/close operations using
the liblabjackusb library and low-level function command/responses. Low-level
function documentation can be found in Section 5 of the LabJack U12, U3, U6,
and UE9 User Guides. The u3.h/u6.h/ue9.h, and u3.c/u6.h/ue9.c files contain
helpful functions for opening/closing USB connections, calculate checksums,
retrieving device analog calibration information, etc. There are 5 "easy"
functions (eAIN, eDAC, eDI, eDO, eTCConfig and eTCValues) that are similar to
our Windows LabJackUD driver's "easy" functions. All other .c files are
examples.

USB command/response times for the U3, U6 and UE9 can be found in section 3.1
of their User's Guide and were tested with the Feedback low-level function. USB
Stream times are in Section 3.2. These times were measured in Windows and are
similar in Linux and Mac OS X. 

Examples are not provided for the Digit or T7 in this package. Please refer to
the LJM library package and documentation for their API.

The U12 also has a high-level library, which requires this library
(liblabjackusb), that provides the same API as the U12 Windows driver. It can
be downloaded here:
