This directory contains programs and routines for creating, 
modifying, and using vector fonts.


PROGRAM SYMGEN is an interactive program for creating or modifying 
font description files XXXX.FNT, and is invoked with

   % make symgen             (requires ../libPlt.a)
   % symgen XXXX

The header of symgen.f has a description of the format of
a XXXX.FNT file, although this is of no concern to the user.
SYMGEN can create an include file XXXX.INC which has the
font encoding placed into Fortran DATA statements.  XXXX.INC
is then compiled with a Versaplot SYMBOL-type routine which
is used in applications. 

Four sample databases, include files, and application routines 
already exist.  The application routines are in ../plt_font.f:

 CHAR.FNT  CHAR.INC   SUBR. PLCHAR   (Upper,lower case letters, WYSIWYG)
 SLAN.FNT  SLAN.INC   SUBR. PLSLAN   (Upper,lower case slanted letters)
 MATH.FNT  MATH.INC   SUBR. PLMATH   (Latex-like Greek symbols, exponents)
 SYMB.FNT  SYMB.INC   SUBR. PLSYMB   (Versaplot plotting symbols)

    also available:   SUBR. PLNUMB   (Whole floating-point numbers)

One can generate analogous files and plot routines for any 
custom font, e.g.

 USER.FNT  USER.INC   SUBR. PLUSER


PROGRAM TEST plots the complete CHAR, SLAN, MATH, and SYMB fonts,
and also plots sample character strings for examination.

   % make test
   % test
